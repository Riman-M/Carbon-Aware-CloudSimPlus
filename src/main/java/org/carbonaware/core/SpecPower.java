/**
 * Measured host power as a function of CPU utilisation.
 *
 * <p>Dell Inc., PowerEdge XR8620T (Intel Xeon Gold 6433N, 2.00 GHz), 32 cores,
 * 256 GB. SPECpower_ssj2008, tested 15 Jul 2024, published 13 Aug 2024,
 * 6,564 overall ssj_ops/watt.
 * spec.org/power_ssj2008/results/res2024q3/power_ssj2008-20240716-01419.html
 *
 * <p>The simulated host in {@code Simulator} matches the benchmarked one
 * exactly -- same core count, clock and memory -- so the curve is used as
 * published, with no rescaling.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this lives here rather than in a CloudSim power model.</b>
 * {@code CarbonMeter} is the only consumer of power values in this study, and
 * CloudSim Plus's {@code PowerModelHostSpec} constructor signature varies
 * between releases. Keeping the curve in plain Java removes a version
 * dependency from the one number the paper reports. Hosts are still given a
 * {@code PowerModelHostSimple} so the simulator's own bookkeeping is
 * well-formed, but nothing in the results is read from it.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it replaced a linear placeholder, and why that matters.</b>
 * The earlier model assumed 120 W idle against a 480 W peak -- an idle fraction
 * of 25%. The real machine idles at 230 W against 420 W, a fraction of 55%. The
 * dynamic range a scheduler can influence is therefore 190 W, not 360 W, so
 * every host in use carries a much larger fixed cost and the gap between
 * concentrating and spreading load narrows. Savings computed under the
 * placeholder were systematically overstated.
 *
 * <p>The curve is also strongly non-linear -- nearly flat from 0-30% load
 * (230 to 273 W), steep from 30-60% (273 to 372 W), flat again above 70%
 * (385 to 420 W). A straight line between idle and peak misprices both ends,
 * which is exactly the range the capacity sweep traverses.
